As we cautiously emerge from the second lockdown there are good reasons to be optimistic.  On the health front, the UK’s rollout of the vaccination is a model for the rest of the world to follow and most of us will have had both jabs of the vaccines by autumn. On the economic front, the initial indications are that we will have a strong economic bounce back over the summer as we start spending the money that has been saved over the last year. All of this means that life should hopefully return to some level of normality by September.

However, lest we forget, the reason for the lockdown was to get the R number down and avoid an exponential explosion of the pandemic and ultimately to save our NHS.  Whilst most people understand in a vaguely theoretical way the implications of the threatened exponential explosion of the epidemic and probably saw the harrowing images from Northern Italy last year no one has until now encountered the absolute horror of what exponential growth of the pandemic means. Over the last two weeks we have glimpsed the coronavirus in its full ferocity in India as we have gone from normal everyday life to a full blown apocalyptic health crisis in just 2 weeks. This account by our team on the front line in India is not only a salutary lesson to all of us about just how lethal the coronavirus is but also a clear warning that we must not lower our guard or become complacent. This is particularly pertinent because perhaps the biggest fallacy we face is the belief that a double jab of vaccines will protect us from the increasing array of Covid variants that are slowly emerging all over the world. What is happening in India has clear implications for the rest of the world over the next six months and there is a very real possibility that if people abandon covid safe behaviour we will face a third lockdown before the end of the year.

As little as two months ago, The Times raised the prospect that India appeared to have beaten the coronavirus -along with the English Cricket Team in the Test series.  Infections were down to about 1,500 infections a day (an insignificant amount in a country with a population of 1.4 billion) and life had more or less returned to the pre-pandemic norms. The low numbers of infections and deaths were attributed to a number of factors from Indians achieving herd immunity to being better equipped to deal with viruses and bacterial infection.  In November 2020, the BBC reported that “new research by Indian scientists suggests that low hygiene, lack of clean drinking water, and unsanitary conditions may have actually saved many lives from severe Covid-19.”

Earlier in October 2020, in a keynote address at UN ECOSOC Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi credited the remarkable recovery rate of 86.2% of Indian infected with Covid-19 to India’s grassroots health systems. 

Belief in Indian exceptionalism steadily grew between November 2020 and mid-March 2021 as the official figures showed a clear downward trend in confirmed cases of Covid-19 infections and politicians declared victory over the coronavirus. By the end of February 2021, there was genuine optimism in the country as fear of coronavirus receded into the country’s rear-view mirror.  The total number of confirmed corona virus infections stood at 11.2 million, with daily infections steady at 1,500 and recorded fatalities at 113. The Indian Election Commission felt confident enough about the outlook for public health to announce that local elections would be held in 4 states between 27 March to 29 April 2021 with 230 million people going to the polls. This announcement was the starter gun for a couple of months of intense political rallies, particularly in the hotly contested state election for control of West Bengal where rallies can easily have in excess of 200,000 people attending. As India embraced the return to normality, people abandoned covid safe behaviour of hygiene, social distancing and wearing masks.

At the beginning of March 2021, there was nothing to indicate that something extraordinary was about to happen.  The total number of confirmed cases of Covid 19 stood at 11,210,799 and it had taken two months for the total cases to increase by a million from mid December’s figure of just over 10 million.  In the following 28 days to 29 March 2021 the confirmed cases increased to 12,485,509.  In the next two weeks the confirmed cases increased by a further 2 million to 14,788,109.  By 26 April 2021 the total number of official confirmed cases is likely to be in the region 17 million with a daily infection rate now having broken through the 300,000 per day ceiling. Unless India’s vaccination program expands dramatically there is a real risk that by the end of May 2021, the official figures for the confirmed Covid cases could well be in excess of 35 million.

This is a textbook example of exponential growth.  It is now becoming increasingly clear that far from retreating at the end of 2020, the virus was merely gathering speed in what appears to have been the initial phase of its exponential spread.

With hindsight it is easy to put this catastrophe down to complacency, failure to follow covid-19 protocols and premature confidence that the coronavirus had been defeated.  In a recent Op Ed in Bloomberg, Mihir Sharma gave a blistering assessment of what had gone wrong,"As is typical in India, official arrogance, hyper-nationalism, populism and an ample dose of bureaucratic incompetence have combined to create a crisis." To be fair to the Indian government the situation is more complicated and unfortunately there are clear parallels between the Indian response and the way that governments in the western world, particularly in the US and UK, have dealt with the pandemic. There is a real danger that political pressure to allow life to normal will trump the continuance of unpopular  health precautions including lockdowns and restrictions that have been imposed for over a year now. 

What is happening in India is an object lesson in what can happen if people lower their guard in the belief that the coronavirus is under control. To appreciate the true scale of the problem you need to understand the uniquely Indian issues that mean that the official statistics are grossly understated. With a population of 1.4 billion, India has about 1 doctor for 1,457 people.  Apart from the lack of healthcare for the vast majority of its population this has meant that throughout its modern history it has been simply impossible to get about 80% of deaths medically certified with a cause of death. It has taken a decade to increase the number of deaths that are medically certified with cause of death from 19% to 21%. This means that about 80% of dead bodies in India are simply cremated or buried without any medical certification or record of the cause of death. The covid deaths that have been officially certified and included in the statistics are in the 21% of the medically certified deaths. There are reports that even people being rushed to hospitals with low oxygen numbers and dying from the lack of resources available are not being recorded as covid deaths. It is arguable if these numbers are extrapolated to the whole population that the real number of deaths from Covid-19 up to 19 April 2021 is not 178,793 but more realistically about 700,000. 

Also due to the lack of testing the number of confirmed cases of covid infections has been grossly underestimated.  In July and August 2020, a sero-survey carried out in Mumbai, Delhi and Pune found that the virus was more widespread than indicated through confirmatory tests. A sero-survey involves carrying out a blood test on a given population to determine the prevalence of antibodies to the Covid-19 virus.  This identifies people who may not have shown symptoms of Covid-19 infection but could have transmitted the disease onto others.    In Pune a city with a population of 4 million just over 51% of the people tested were found to have antibodies specific to the novel coronavirus. Similar figures were found in both Delhi and Mumbai.  In Delhi it was believed that the actual spread could be 40 times greater than the number of confirmed cases. At the time scientists believed the disparity between the death rates and the number of people who had been infected with Covid-19 could be down to Indians developing herd immunity. More recent testing in Delhi supports the results of the sero survey and found that 1 in 3 of those tested had the coronavirus antibodies. The implication of this is that the true figure for Covid cases in India could be about 30 times higher at 400 million than the official figure of 15 million.

Apart from the misleading official numbers of confirmed coronavirus infections the myth of Indian exceptionalism was heavily promoted for political purposes. The coronavirus pandemic is probably the first pandemic that is in the thrall of political and nationalist forces around the world.  India has not been an exception to this.  For instance, in an effort to boost the attendance at the Maha Kumbh Mela held in the city of Haridwar every 12 years, Tirath Singh Rawat, the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand reassured everyone that “…Kumbh is at the bank of the River Ganga. Maa Ganga’s blessings are there in the flow. So, there should be no corona” The festival is one of the largest religious gatherings in the world and on auspicious bathing days the number of pilgrims going to the bath in the Ganges can be as high as 3.5 million people.  It is anticipated that the final bathing day as the festival closes on 27 April 2021 will be attended by a record number of people despite ongoing concerns and warnings about speed with which the virus is spreading across India.

The major concern in relation to this festival is that it brings people from all parts of India (as well as international tourists) together in a concentrated mass where there is no social distancing or masks. These are perfect conditions not only for the spread of the coronavirus but also for the incubation of mutant variants like India’s home-grown Double Mutant Variant.  At the end of the festival these people will disperse back to their homes with a significant risk that they carry the Covid-19 virus or a mutant variant back with them. 

Almost as a footnote, in addition to the Kumbh Mela festival the first quarter of 2021 has seen intense activity in political campaigning for the elections in West Bengal between the incumbent TMC party led by Mamata Banerjee and the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party BJP.  The political stakes are high and both campaigns have seen rally with up to 200,000 to 300,000 people at a time.  For Mr Modi’s campaign rally on 7 March, it is reported that nearly 800,000 people turned up. At these rallies it seems mandatory not to observe social distancing or wear masks. Or if masks are worn to ensure they are firmly below noses.

As the pandemic sweeps through India there are likely to be consequences that will affect all of us. Firstly, it is extremely likely that there will be a host of new mutant variants that will appear over the next few months. These new mutant variants will not only be from India but also from countries in Africa and South America where there will be in delays in getting vaccine supplies as India is forced to focus its attention on its own population.

One of the key characteristics of the coronavirus is that it tends to highlight social and economic inequality.  The poor suffer disproportionately more as they simply do not have the wherewithal to access the medical resources that could potentially save their lives.  In a country where, by some measures, a quarter of the population lives in poverty the consequences of the covid tsunami can be seen on social media feeds and news channels showing bodies piling up outside overcrowded hospitals in which at times people share beds and long queues outside crematoriums in nearly all cities. In Surat, the steel pipes in a local crematorium melted from constant use in 24-hour cycles as the number of bodies increases from 20 to over 100 a day. In another crematorium in Surat, five dead bodies were cremated on one pyre as the local authorities were trying to cope with the surge in deaths. There are multiple reports from all major Indian cities of lines of people with bodies of dead relatives waiting for hours to get the bodies cremated.

Families forced to wait in line for hours for the funeral of the deceased in every cemetery.

All of this in the first two weeks of April before the numbers double in the next phase of exponential growth of the pandemic.

“India leads the world in the daily average number of new infections reported, accounting for one in every 3 infections reported worldwide each day” -By Reuters

This virus is not like the old coronavirus.  The new double mutant variant attacks lungs more ferociously s damaging patients' lungs more quickly and is more infectious and spreading through whole families at a time. Also unlike the original virus the new variant hasn't just hit older patients, or those with pre-existing health conditions. This time around the number of young people getting infected is much higher.

Politically it is impossible for the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to impose a national lockdown.  Accordingly, individuals states are taking whatever measures they can to try and bring the virus under control.  These measures range from a partial lockdown to imposing curfews like the one we have in Gujarat. On 7 April 2021 the Chief Minister of Gujarat Vijay Rupani imposed a night curfew in Gujarat that commences at 8pm to 6am.  Perversely this may actually increase the spread of the virus. In India, April and May are typically the hottest months of the year with peak daytime temperatures peaking at around 40 degrees centigrade.  Accordingly, most shopping is either done early in the morning or the evenings.  Restriction of movement in the evenings has simply meant that all commercial activity takes place in the morning with double the crowds before the punishing afternoon heat. Also, social interactions are not reduced but simply concentrated into a shorter more concentrated timeframe.
Beleaguered business owners have given up hope of any financial support from the government and are struggling to understand the logic of nightly curfews.  Not unreasonably they question whether Indian scientists have established that the coronavirus only come out at night.
With the benefit of hindsight, it is extremely easy to be critical of the Indian government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and its premature chest-thumping declarations of victory earlier this year.  However, the truth is that political leaders across the world has been found wanting throughout this crisis as they have cocooned themselves in the hubris that they understood what they were dealing with.  Mr Modi’s misfortune is that with the size of the population of India there was no margin for error.

There are clear lessons for the rest of the world from India’s experience over the last month.  The first of these is that no matter how positive the outlook appears this is likely to simply be a lull and there is a real danger that if the covid safety protocols requiring hygiene, social distancing and masks are abandoned there is a real risk that one of the variants will take hold.

Also, the idea that there are green zone countries where we can safely travel for summer holidays is a fallacy.  India has the largest diaspora population in the world with 18 million people from the country living outside their homeland. It is difficult to see how you can avoid any mixing at all if these people travel through any of the international travel hubs like Dubai or Turkey  At the very least summer holidays abroad should be on hold until the whole country has had both jabs of the vaccines.

We also need to accept that the vaccines we get will not prevent any of us from getting infected by one of the coronavirus variants that are mutating in India.  India has administered over 127 million of doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that’s enough to have vaccinated about 4.7% of the country’s population. India has expanded its vaccination programme from 1st May for all adults over 18 with the hope of slowing down the second wave.  According to experts the government will unlike meet its target of 250 million people by July due to shortages and restrictions with healthcare workers and frontline staff. These measures are not enough to stop the continued exponential spread of the virus and it is almost inevitable that there will a number of new mutant variants over the next few months. At the date of writing this, in addition to the double mutant variant there is now also a triple mutant variant.  India’s population provides the perfect breeding ground for further mutations.  

In the face of this onslaught the fundamental truth voiced by the World Health Organisation, that no one is safe until everyone is safe, has to be recognised and acted upon.  If African and South American countries cannot get their populations vaccinated they too will simply become fertile breeding grounds for new variants each progressively becoming more deadlier and infectious than the previous iterant. The nightmare scenario is the possibility that there is ultimately a variant that can evade detection by the diagnostic tests that are currently available and is able to overcome the immunization protection offered by the current crop of vaccines. 

Since the existence of mutant strains is inevitable we have to use any lull in the spread of infections to shore up our defenses and ensure that our medical professionals are equipped with both the equipment and resources to fight the next round when it comes.  Hopefully, over the next few months we can rise above our nationalistic instincts and recognise human exceptionalism and our ability to care for each other rather than just ourselves.
